# dataplane — Release Notes

## 2026.7.2

Bumps `version` + `appVersion` to `2026.7.2`. `appVersion` moves from `2026.7.0` to
`2026.7.2`, so this release points at new data-plane (operator / executor / propeller /
dataproxy) images (notes below are the diff against the last stable release, `2026.7.1`,
whose `appVersion` was still `2026.7.0`).

### Configuration changes (helm-charts)

- **AWS storage overlay migrated to the stow backend** ([#493](https://github.com/unionai/helm-charts/pull/493)) — **fixes an executor crashloop**. The `provider: aws` branch of `_storage.tpl` emitted the legacy `type: s3` native connection block. flytestdlib's multi-scheme DataStore refactor ([flyteorg/flyte#7555](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/7555)) routes every storage `Type` through stow and dropped the `type: s3` shorthand, so a `type: s3` config with no `stow.kind` panics `unsupported stow.kind []` at executor startup. AWS was the last provider not on stow (`gcs`/`azure`/`compat` already were). Now emits `type: stow` + `stow.kind: s3` driven by `authType` (IRSA and `accesskey` both render correctly). **AWS data planes should adopt this chart in lockstep with the `2026.7.2` executor image.**
- **Corrected Azure/GCP overlay defaults** ([#490](https://github.com/unionai/helm-charts/pull/490)):
  - *Namespace mapping (Azure + GCP).* GKE Workload Identity and Azure federated credentials have no wildcard subject support, so task namespaces must be a bounded set. The overlays pin `namespace_mapping.template` to `{{ domain }}`. On Azure this was previously nested under a `namespace_config` key the propeller ConfigMap never reads, so it was silently ignored and Azure fell through to the unbounded `{{project}}-{{domain}}` default. Moved to the correct top-level `namespace_mapping` key, gated on `not singleNamespace`.
  - *Azure operator secret backend.* The Azure overlay routed the operator's secret manager to Key Vault, but the flyte pod webhook reads the embedded K8s secret. Azure now defaults to the embedded K8s secret manager, matching AWS/GCP.
- **Eager API key minted per cluster** ([#486](https://github.com/unionai/helm-charts/pull/486)) — the dataplane now includes its cluster name when minting the eager API key, the chart half of per-data-plane operator + eager OAuth clients. Pairs with the control-plane `apiKeyOverrides` list ([controlplane #491](https://github.com/unionai/helm-charts/pull/491)) and requires the `2026.7.2` images.

### Platform (data-plane images — `appVersion 2026.7.2`)

High-level summary of the behavior in the images this chart now points at:

- **Operator / apps.** App pod startup failures are classified into a terminal FAILED state instead of hanging. Custom `pod_template` annotations are no longer dropped — they're merged into the pod. The reconcile loop re-asserts org-scoped `app.disallow_anonymous` via a durable KService annotation, remediating apps deployed before the policy was enabled.
- **App logs.** Persistent/long-lived app-log support in the operator's log service, with the dataproxy path falling back to persisted backends (CloudWatch / Stackdriver) for scaled-to-zero apps.
- **Observability.** The operator emits connector app-replica metrics, reports the Helm chart version per cluster, and supports `write_relabel_configs` on Prometheus `remote_write`.
- **fasttask.** fasttask login config is now wired correctly on the leaseworker/operator.
- **Connectors.** flyte2 bump: connector `ListConnectors` polling reuses persistent keepalive gRPC connections instead of re-dialing each poll.

### Migration / action required

- **AWS data planes: adopt in lockstep with the executor image** ([#493](https://github.com/unionai/helm-charts/pull/493)). Once the executor rolls to a `2026.7.2` image (post-flyte#7555), an older chart still emitting `type: s3` crashloops the executor. Bump chart + image together. No action for GCP/Azure/OCI.
- **Per-cluster eager API key** ([#486](https://github.com/unionai/helm-charts/pull/486)) is coupled to the control-plane `apiKeyOverrides` list shape ([#491](https://github.com/unionai/helm-charts/pull/491)) and the `2026.7.2` images — bump control plane and data plane together.
- **Azure namespace mapping** ([#490](https://github.com/unionai/helm-charts/pull/490)): if you previously worked around the ignored `namespace_config` key with a manual override, drop it — the overlay now sets `namespace_mapping` correctly under multi-namespace (`low_privilege=false`) mode.

## 2026.7.1

Chart-only patch release on top of `2026.7.0`; `appVersion` stayed `2026.7.0`. Highlights: zero-trust mode GA for BYOC data planes with a ready-to-use `examples/values.zero-trust.yaml` overlay; single canonical `operator.enableTunnelService` toggle; consolidated control-plane host resolution (fails fast if unset); chart-managed PriorityClasses for leaseworker/flytepropeller. See [PR #483](https://github.com/unionai/helm-charts/pull/483).

## 2026.7.0

First stable `2026.7.0`; `version` + `appVersion` bumped to `2026.7.0`. Highlights: dataplane self-registration — each data plane reports a bare `host` + TLS posture in `Status.connection_config` on every heartbeat so the control plane can route to it directly (opt-in via `updateStatus.connectionConfig.enabled`); billing defaults to v2 usage-based collection. See [PR #472](https://github.com/unionai/helm-charts/pull/472).
